Either -> Either the signal has a high enough deviation from the recent average, or it is close enough to the recent maximum.

replace concept of maximumLoudness with a long-history-interval timed queue ->
determine the loudest value over the last X seconds. the Lmax is then the average of those over the last Y seconds.


if the triggering loudnesses are all about the same loudness -> ok
if the have large deviation -> increase the trigger threshold



add a Sensitivity trait -> give it the max bpm -> avoids overtriggering



the StandardServer does not use lastDidTrigger (correctly) -> this is causing random double triggers
